We were inspired by the Trappist tradition of the Belgian Single. Brothers Bier is a SMaSH beer brewed from Pilsen malt and Sterling hops, and fermented to a nice dry finish with our traditional Trappist yeast strain. A late hop addition of Sterling adds a bit of spicy, citrusy hop aroma and flavor to the quintessential fruity-spicy yeast character of a classic Belgian Single. ","2020-08-04 12:55:00"

Black ale with aromas and flavours of vanilla, dark chocolate, bourbon and roasted malt. The vanilla and cocoa marry nicely, without out-competing each other, to produce a surprisingly well balanced beer. This beer is mildly hoppy, but the cocoa introduces a touch of bitterness. Its colour may be intimidating, but it is a very smooth beer within reach of most beer drinkers. This highly appreciated dessert beer is brewed with organic fair-trade cocoa and first rate vanilla beans. ","2020-08-01 23:28:01"

Our interpretation of an English Stock Ale, this beer was brewed as a Strong Ale in November 2018 before being spontaneously refermented in oak barrels and allowed to age for a year in the barrels. The beer was then naturally conditioned in casks and bottles, and aged for a further six months. The beer is slightly tart, with notes of cherry, leather and tobacco. ","2020-08-01 23:28:01"

Tough Love is bold but nuanced, an homage of sorts to the traditional Russian Imperial Stouts and the ruling style of Catherine the Great. We construct it with dark roasted malts, malted rye, and oak-smoked wheat, and then banish it in Kentucky bourbon barrels. The aging process smooths out the edges on an otherwise bold statement, and bitterness succumbs to tender strokes of vanilla beans, hints of dried cherries, and new layers revealing themselves with each sip.
